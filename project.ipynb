    "The code contained data for housing prices in Amsterdam. We ran it to verify this data, then ran it again for housing data from across the United States. We found that the fit scores were, in general, much lower for this new data set than for the original one. Additionally, the score ordering changed to a large degree. The scoring results are enumerated as follows:\n",

    "Random forest regression and MLP regression seem to perform the best overall, while ridge and lasso regression seem to perform the worst. Of note is that the XGBoost regression performed significantly worse for the USA housing price data. This is likely because of the fewer tuning parameters in this data set, as well as poor filter tuning to begin with.\n",
